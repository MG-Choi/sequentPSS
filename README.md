## Usage (using sample simulation in library)

### 1. Preprocessing

The SPS algorithm consists of preprocessing and sequential calibration stages, with validation being optional. In this study, \( k \) number of parameters are denoted as \( X \), while \( d \) number of outcomes are denoted as \( Y \). The mathematical representation is:

$$
X = \{X_1, X_2, \cdots X_i, \cdots, X_k\} \in \mathbb{R}^k
$$

$$
Y = \{Y_1, Y_2, \cdots Y_j, \cdots, Y_d\} \in \mathbb{R}^d
$$


Each parameter \( X \) takes a parameter value \( x \) in the parameter space. 

#### 1.1 set parameter and hyperparameter


``` python
import sequentPSS as sqp

# set parameter spaces
x1_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
x2_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
x3_list = [1,2,3,4,5]

# set hyper parameters
M = 150
k = 3

# ---  run simulations for M(2k+2) times with random parameter values---
multi_simul_df = sqp.multiple_simple_simulation(x1_list, x2_list, x3_list, M, k) 

multi_simul_df.head()
```

#### 1.2 determining rmse_sel for calibration

- Algorithm 1. Preprocessing (1): Determining a Criterion for Calibration

<img src="/sequentPSS/screenshot/Algorithm1.png" alt="Preprocessing(1): determining a criterion for calibration" width="600"/>

In the preprocessing step, the criterion for calibration, RMSE<sub>sel</sub>, is determined as illustrated in Algorithm 1. During process (1), a parameter value x is randomly selected for each X<sub>i</sub> based on a uniform distribution. These values are then combined to compute RMSE<sub>tem</sub> in each iteration. This procedure continues until reaching M(2k+2) iterations, as outlined in equation 1.

RMSE, a widely-used metric for model calibration, is employed here to assess the discrepancy between simulated outcomes and observed data. The threshold RMSE<sub>sel</sub> is set for each Y<sub>j</sub> as the upper limit RMSE from any parameter combination. Users can adjust the leniency index μ to control the calibration rigor. For instance, with a μ value of 0.1, the lower 10% of all RMSE values become the RMSE<sub>sel</sub> criteria. Setting μ too low might lead to overfitting, while a higher value can introduce undue uncertainty.

``` python
# --- preprocessing 1: determining a criterion for calibration

O_list = [sqp.O1, sqp.O2, sqp.O3] # observed data to list -
u = 0.1
rmse_sel_df, multi_simul_df_rmse_sel = sqp.prep1_criterion(O_list, multi_simul_df, u, k)

# now, we have the rmse_sel for all O (observed data O1, O2, O3 corresponding to y1, y2, y3).
rmse_sel_df
```

#### 1.3 sorting Y and X for calibration

```python

# --- preprocessing 2: sorting Y for calibration

y_seq_df = sqp.sorting_Y(multi_simul_df_rmse_sel)
y_seq_df

```

![y_seq_df](/sequentPSS/screenshot/y_seq_df.png)

```python

# --- preprocessing 3: sorting X based on sensitivity analysis for calibration
problem = {
    'num_vars': 3,
    'names': ['x1', 'x2', 'x3'],
    'bounds': [[1, 5],
               [1, 5],
               [1, 5]]
}

x_seq_df = sqp.sorting_X(problem, multi_simul_df_rmse_sel, GSA = 'RBD-FAST') # run GSA
x_seq_df

```
![x_seq_df](/sequentPSS/screenshot/x_seq_df.png)

Now we have rmse_sel, sorted y and sorted x, we can run sequential calibration.


### 2. sequential calibration
#### 2.1 round 1: calibrate parameters with y1
```python
# -- now we need to run sequential calibration with the previous sequence of y and x (y1 -> y3 -> y2 / x3 -> x2 -> x1) --
# First round of y1: fix x3
x1_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
x2_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
x3_list = [1,2,3,4,5]

fix_x3_y1_simul_result_df = fix_param_simple_simulation(x1_list, x2_list, x3_list, fix_x = 'x3', M = 100) # fix x3: fix each x3 value one by one and run 100 times of simulation

x3_list, result_df = seqCalibration(fix_x = 'x3', fix_y = 'y1', rmse_sel = 401.295316, simul_result_df = fix_x3_y1_simul_result_df,  O_list = O_list, t = 0.2, df_return = True)

print('updated x3 parameter space:', x3_list)
```

```
reliability of 'x3' for 'y1' (1 - uncertainty degree):  {3: 0.59, 4: 0.91, 5: 1.0}
updated x3 parameter space: [3, 4, 5]
```

Sequential calibration is conducted in the order of sorted y and x values. 
The first step involves fixing x3 (and calibrate with y1).
The RMSE_sel value corresponding to y1 and its matching O1 values are used (401.295316), along with the tolerance index (t).

The calibration results are as follows:
1. Calibration based on y1 in round 1 led to the following outcomes:

- x1: [1,2,3,4,5] -> [3,4,5]
- x2: [1,2,3,4,5] -> [1,2,3,4,5]
- x3: [1,2,3,4,5] -> [1,2,3,4,5]

2. Calibration based on y3 in round 2 led to the following outcomes:

- x1: [3,4,5] -> [4,5]
- x2: [1,2,3,4,5] -> [1,2,3,4,5]
- x3: [1,2,3,4,5] -> [1,2,3,4,5]
